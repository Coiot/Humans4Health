## Rick Dandrow

To keep it simple, and if I were to define myself, it is easy;** “Rick** is a husband and a father....a normal guy”.  I was an average athlete in the past, and I am an average athlete and health and fitness advocate today.  However, I have recently been inspired to take on the initiative of sharing my own fitness struggles.  The struggle between my desire to be in peak physical fitness and participate in endurance events, and the reality of how my primary life and it's time commitments makes this endeavor, very difficult.

Like most adults in this world, I have a full time job and rely on that employment to support the lifestyle I have chosen for myself and my family.  What is not surprising (Like most of you) I also have a variety of other life commitments that consume my time daily.  TIME is the one commodity that we must all better understand if we choose to live a healthier lifestyle. The fact is, our primary roles are most likely linked to activities that are not even remotely connected to the health and fitness industries.  Therefore, health and fitness often becomes a low priority or secondary to the activities of our daily lives.  As a consequence, our health and fitness often become “seasonal”.  

It is my desire to help define what “Health and Fitness” means to people.  And that it is very different for each person.  Magazine covers should not define our wellness.  Once this is understood, it becomes easier to build a sustainable, realistic plan that you can consistently execute within your specific lifestyle and time constraints.  You can make significant changes in your life with limited time.  Therefore, It is my goal to explore how we can do this in the most time efficient way possible. 

I want to do this through building  a community of humans sharing their successes, struggles, and mutual encouragement to keep fighting towards lifestyles that help us all live healthier and more physically fit lifestyles….let’s get rid of the “season” of health and fitness from our lives!

I want to be the average guy who helps others do uncommon things that ultimately help you achieve a healthier lifestyle. I know this community of sharing will ultimately help me stay inspired!
