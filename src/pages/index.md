    title: Strides & Strokes!
    content: >
      The inaugural fundraising event for Humans 4 Health Inc. will be in honor
      of all of the medical professionals that are dedicated to the research,
      treatment, and recovery of all patients that have been impacted by a
      Stroke.


      We are partnering with the **AdventHealth Foundation | Central Florida**
      for the benefit of the **AdventHealth Neuroscience Institute**.


      The event will take place on May 28 and 29, 2021. 10:00 A.M. (Friday May,
      28), to 10:00 A.M. (Saturday May 29), The location will be in Baldwin
      Park, Florida, circling Lake Baldwin.


      The significance of our endurance event is to honor the 24 hour, seven day
      a week impact a stroke has on the person, their families, friends and
      ultimately their life.  Recovery and rehabilitation is far more
      challenging than one 24 hour event. It is our hope to bring recognition to
      those who challenge themselves to overcome this preventable condition.  We
      also hope to inspire others to try and live healthier lifestyles.


      The participants of this 24-hour event will be by invitation only however,
      we encourage everyone in the community to come and encourage the
      participants throughout the duration of this event.  We also hope that
      this event inspires you to take the first step in living a healthier
      lifestyle...come walk one lap of the many laps completed by the
      competitors.

          I have a personal connection to this initiative.  I lost my mother to
          stroke complications in May of 2018.
        subtitle: 'Rick Dandrow, Founder of Humans4Health'
        content: >
          My Mother, Mary Ann, had suffered some minor stroke episodes leading
          up to the final brain injury in May 2018 and days later she was gone.


          At the end of that same year, I had a close friend suffer a stroke. 
          He is two years younger than I, and continues to this day, to try and
          regain the lifestyle he once had.  Two years later, he continues to
          fight.  What is so impressive about my dear friend James and his Wife
          Margaret, is their never ending will to fight.  A fight that requires
          endurance, a fight that requires multiple layers of care.  A fight
          that has been supported by family and friends, and their love of God. 
          What is astounding, Is that I have never personally witnessed James
          and Margaret without a smile. Negative attitudes have not been present
          in their recovery.


          It is their will and determination that has inspired me to dedicate
          our first fundraising initiative to the professionals who have
          provided care to James throughout the recovery journey he has so
          impressively stayed committed.


          James's care has been provided by the medical professionals of
          **AdventHealth Central Florida**.
