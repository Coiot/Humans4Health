    title: Strides & Strokes!
    content: >-
      The inaugural/first public offering Humans 4 Health Inc. fundraising event will be in honor of all of the medical professionals that are dedicated to the research, treatment, and recovery of all patients that have been impacted by a Stroke. 


      The event will take place on May 28 and 29, 2021. 10:00 A.M. (Friday May, 28), to 10:00 A.M. (Saturday May 29), The location will be in Baldwin Park, Florida, circling Lake Baldwin.


      The significance of our endurance event is to honor the 24 hour, seven day a week impact a stroke has on the person, their families, friends and ultimately their life.  Recovery and rehabilitation is far more challenging than one 24 hour event. It is our hope to bring recognition to those who challenge themselves to overcome this preventable condition.

        title: I have a personal connection to this initiative.  I lost my mother to stroke complications in May of 2018.
        subtitle: "Rick Dandrow, Founder of Humans4Health"
        content: >-
          My Mother, Mary Ann, had suffered some minor stroke episodes leading up to the final brain injury in May 2018 and days later she was gone. 


          At the end of that same year, I had a close friend suffer a stroke.  He is two years younger than I, and continues to this day, to try and regain the lifestyle he once had.  Two years later, he continues to fight.  What is so impressive about my dear friend James and his Wife Margaret, is their never ending will to fight.  A fight that requires endurance, a fight that requires multiple layers of care.  A fight that has been supported by family and friends, and their love of God.  What is astounding, Is that I have never personally witnessed James and Margaret without a smile. Negative attitudes have not been present in their recovery. 


          It is their will and determination that has inspired me to dedicate our first fundraising initiative to the professionals who have provided care to James throughout the recovery journey he has so impressively stayed committed.
